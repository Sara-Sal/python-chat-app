# python-chat-app
A chat app that uses tkinter to create GUI, and connects the users (clients) to a centralized server. Based on https://medium.com/swlh/lets-write-a-chat-app-in-python-f6783a9ac170?fbclid=IwAR3PJWr0l7yEA6PvmGjoEihw3iLFls5-hKboBVWtaoOqrmrJy0-RUJpkhAk 

If running server on the same machine as the client, run the server code directly:

python3 server.py

otherwise, change the HOST variable in client.py to the IP address of the serving machine, then run the code as directed.

Run the client code:

python3 client.py

and log in with a username. Now you're connected!
